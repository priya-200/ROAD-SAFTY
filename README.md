## Road Safety EDA Project: Exploring and Understanding Key Factors for Safer Roads ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
<p>This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a Road Safety dataset, aiming to uncover insights that can help improve road safety. The analysis explores various factors that contribute to road accidents, such as driver behavior, weather conditions, and vehicle-related data, in order to understand patterns and identify potential risk factors. The goal is to leverage data-driven insights to inform safer driving practices, optimize traffic management, and enhance public safety policies.</p>p>

## Key Steps in the Project:
1.Data Collection & Cleaning: The project begins by working with a large dataset of road safety incidents, with over 363,243 rows and 67 columns. Initial data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
2.Feature Engineering: Key features such as age of the driver, vehicle type, and weather conditions are explored to understand their impact on accident frequency and severity.
3.Visualization: Various visualization techniques (e.g., heatmaps, pair plots) are used to understand the distribution of key variables and detect any potential correlations.
4.Advanced EDA: Techniques like correlation analysis, distribution plots, and aggregation are used to dive deeper into the data and uncover hidden patterns related to road safety.
5.Insights & Takeaways: The project identifies factors that most significantly contribute to accidents and offers recommendations for policy makers, traffic authorities, and road safety organizations.

## Key Insights:
Driverâ€™s age and vehicle type play a significant role in accident severity.
Weather conditions and road type have strong correlations with the likelihood of accidents occurring.
By identifying key risk factors, the project aims to contribute to making roads safer through data-informed decisions.
